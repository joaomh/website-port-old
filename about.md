This is a blog/portfolio where I post about my projects and other exciting things in data science, machine learning, and programming.

# João Pinheiro
I hold a degree in Mechatronics Engineering from the University of São Paulo, the best university in LATAM and 85th QS Ranking, and am currently pursuing a master's degree in Mechanical Engineering at the same institution with a research project using machine learning techniques to assist surgeries.

I began my career as an intern at Itaú Unibanco, where I later became a Data Scientist. Currently, I work as a Data Engineer. In addition to my professional pursuits, I also manage a YouTube channel called '2001 Engenharia,' where I create programming videos.
